An added side effect of having [ReadOnly and Writable entities](../readonly-and-wrtiable-entities/) is that all of an entities write operations are now performed via methods, rather than property setters, enabling to us convert Vendr's write API in a fluent API.

## Writing fluently

Where we could perform a write operation as follows

````csharp
using(var uow = _uowProvider.Create())
{
    // Fetch the currency
    var currency = _currencyService.GetCurrency(currencyId);

    // Convert the currency into it's Writable form
    var writableCurrency = currency.AsWritable(uow);

    // Perform the write operation
    writableCurrency.SetName("New Name");

    // Persist the changes to the database
    _currencyService.SaveCurrency(currency);

    // Close the transaction
    uow.Complete();
}

````

...if we preferred, we could simplify this further by defining these actions fluently, chaining all of the entity methods into a succinct command sequence as follows

````csharp
using(var uow = _uowProvider.Create())
{
    var currency = _currencyService.GetCurrency(currencyId)
        .AsWritable(uow)
        .SetName("New Name");

    _currencyService.SaveCurrency(currency);

    uow.Complete();
}

````

<message-box type="info" heading="Fluent API Optional">

We know not everyone likes to write their code fluently and so the Vendr Fluent API is a completely optional feature. Both code examples above are valid coding styles which will both work as well as each other. The Fluent API is an opt-in layer of syntax sugar that developers can use depending on their preferred style of coding.
