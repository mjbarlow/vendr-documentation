## VendrApi

Convenient singleton access to the Vendr API

```csharp
public static class VendrApi
```

**Namespace**
* [Vendr.Core.Web.Api](../)

### Properties

#### Instance

Get the [`IVendrApi`](../ivendrapi/) entry point

```csharp
public static IVendrApi Instance { get; }
```


**Remarks**

This helper is providing singleton access to the Vendr API which generally isn't considered "best practice". You should instead look to resolve the [`IVendrApi`](../ivendrapi/) via dependency injection where possible, and only resort to this singleton where you have no other option.
