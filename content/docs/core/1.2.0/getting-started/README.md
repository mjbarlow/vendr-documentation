description: Getting Started with Vendr, the eCommerce solution for Umbraco v8+
---

In this section we will guide you through the key steps necessary to get you started with Vendr.

It is assumed that before we begin that you already have an Umbraco v8+ website configured, ready to install Vendr into. If you are unsure how to setup a basic Umbraco install, you should review the [Getting Started](https://our.umbraco.com/documentation/getting-started/) documentation on the main Umbraco developer portal and return once you have this in place.

## System Requirements
At this time, the minimum requirements for using Vendr are as follows:
* **Umbraco 8.4+**
* **SQL Server Database** (CE is fine for testing, but not recommend for live deployments)
